# RL_WindPower
Wind turbine wake control based on [floris](https://github.com/NREL/floris)
- After install the floris, just run main.py and we can get the optimized result:
- (**30, 25, 20, 20, 0, 0**) is the yaw angle with the best result of 18.11 % improvement 
- Here is the picture of the yaw angle result
